# Project42-CandidateTest
Candidate Test for Project42

There is two versions of the application both being rendered by a NodeJS express application.

The first version uses AngularJS and the second uses Angular 7.

The reason I chose to do both version is because Angular JS will leave LTS in 2021 and I wanted to show that I can also use Angular 2+ to compensate.

The AngularJS version can be found under the "AngularJS" folder in views and the same for the Angular 7 version can be found in the "Angular7" folder.
